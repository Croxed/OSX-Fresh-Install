# OSX Fresh Install
Some simple configurations and installers for a fresh install of OS X.

## Install
### Install everything
- Run `sh install.sh` in a terminal


### Only Install the Quick Look-plugins
> This requires Homebrew to be installed, so run `sh brewInstall.sh` before doing this.

- Run `sh QLPluginsInstall.sh`

### Optimize the system and install dev-tools
> This requires Homebrew to be installed, so run `sh brewInstall.sh` before doing this.

- Run `sh dotfiles.sh`

>This will install a lot of development tools and will optimize OS X based on my preferences. 
It will also install iTerm 2 and install Solarized Dark-theme for iTerm 2.
